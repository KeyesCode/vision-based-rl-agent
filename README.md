# OSRS-RL — Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning Agent

A portfolio-scale autonomy project: a **PPO policy (implemented from scratch)** learns
to play Old School RuneScape from raw pixels, trained against a fast 2D simulator and
evaluated end-to-end against the real game through a safety-gated input pipeline. The
same Gymnasium env, policy, and checkpoint file drive both paths — only the injected
`GameClient` differs.

## Architecture

The pipeline mirrors the canonical autonomy stack _perception → state → policy → action
→ reward → update_:

- **Perception.** Raw RGB frames from either the 2D simulator or `mss` screen capture.
- **Preprocessing** (`src/osrs_rl/vision/preprocess.py`) — grayscale, resize to 84×84,
  stack the last 4 frames along the channel axis.
- **Gymnasium env** (`src/osrs_rl/env/osrs_env.py`) — wraps a `GameClient` and a
  `CompositeReward`. Exposes `Discrete(7)` actions.
- **PPO policy** (`src/osrs_rl/agents/ppo.py`) — Nature-CNN backbone → shared features →
  actor and critic heads with orthogonal init. Clipped objective, GAE(λ), advantage
  normalization, entropy bonus, LR annealing. No SB3 — every line is in the repo.
- **Rewards** (`src/osrs_rl/rewards/`) — composable `RewardComponent` objects summed
  into a `CompositeReward`: log-collected, step/invalid/idle penalties, distance
  shaping, adjacency bonus, full-inventory bonus.
- **Simulator** (`src/osrs_rl/env/simulator/mock_osrs.py`) — 2D grid OSRS-like
  woodcutting world at ~1000 steps/sec per env. Renders RGB frames at the native
  `grid_size × tile_size` resolution so the visual domain is deterministic and
  debuggable.
- **Live client** (`src/osrs_rl/env/live/live_client.py`) — same `GameClient`
  interface, backed by real screen capture and a `SafetyGate` that gates every
  cursor move, click, and keypress.

## Results

### Episode return over training

![reward over time](docs/results/ppo_woodcutting_v2/reward_over_time.png)

Rolling-mean training return climbs from the random-baseline line (−2.90) to above +15
within 25k steps and stabilizes around +17. The orange dots at −9 are the trainer's
deterministic-argmax evals — see [Limitations](#limitations) for why those stay flat
while the stochastic policy improves dramatically.

### Success rate and trees chopped

![success rate](docs/results/ppo_woodcutting_v2/success_rate.png)
![trees per episode](docs/results/ppo_woodcutting_v2/trees_chopped.png)

### What the policy learned

![action distribution](docs/results/ppo_woodcutting_v2/action_distribution.png)

The trained agent triples INTERACT share vs random, eliminates DROP entirely, drops
IDLE from 14% → 0.3%, and develops a directional navigation bias (MOVE_SOUTH ~2×
MOVE_WEST) — a spatial feature the CNN learned from the training-time tree layouts.

### Optimization diagnostics

![losses](docs/results/ppo_woodcutting_v2/losses.png)

Policy loss near zero (expected for PPO's clipped objective), bounded value loss,
entropy anneals from ~1.9 (uniform) to ~1.5 (committed but still exploring).

### Why PPO works here

The task has a moderately sparse but dense-enough reward (+5 per log, with
potential-based distance shaping) and a small discrete action space. PPO's clipped
objective gives stable improvement without the replay-buffer dynamics that make DQN
sensitive to reward scale and exploration schedule. The CNN backbone learns a useful
spatial representation even at 84×84 grayscale because the semantic units (agent,
tree, stump, HUD bar) are color-separated and tile-aligned. Tree layouts are freshly
randomized on every reset, so the policy cannot memorize — it is learning a
navigation-plus-interact behavior conditioned on current visual state.

## Limitations

Stated honestly rather than hidden:

1. **Deterministic argmax collapses to 100% INTERACT.** The top logit is usually
   INTERACT; movement emerges only from stochastic sampling. A well-trained policy
   would put INTERACT on top _only when a tree is adjacent_. The shared-backbone
   actor doesn't yet separate those two visual states reliably — a representation
   bottleneck, not a reward bottleneck. This is the single biggest structural tell in
   the results.
2. **Success-rate plateau at 10–15%.** Filling inventory needs 10 chops in 300 steps;
   the agent averages 4. The gap is post-chop navigation after tree respawns.
3. **Adjacency-bonus reward did less than expected.** A second training (`v2`) with
   an explicit `+0.5` "became adjacent to a live tree" bonus raised mean return from
   +14.3 to +18.0 but did not lift success rate — confirming the representation
   diagnosis above.
4. **Sim-to-real visual gap is wide.** The simulator's pixel statistics share almost
   nothing with the real OSRS client. The live path (M5) is an infrastructure
   demonstration — closing the visual gap is a dedicated training problem ([Next
   steps](#next-steps-sim-to-real)).
5. **Live evaluation is read-only by default.** `enable_live_input=false` means the
   whole stack runs end-to-end against the live window with zero OS-level side
   effects. Real input requires an explicit config flip and is bounded by a
   bbox + rate limit + kill-switch file.

## Live OSRS evaluation

The live client implements `GameClient` so the trained checkpoint runs against the
real game with zero code changes to training/eval. Every OS-level side effect flows
through `SafetyGate`:

1. `enable_live_input` must be `true` (default `false` → every action is audit-logged
   but blocked at dispatch).
2. Kill-switch file — presence of `/tmp/osrs_rl_stop` denies every subsequent action.
3. Rate limit (`max_actions_per_second`).
4. Safe bounding box — any move or click whose target falls outside is denied.
5. Audit log for every approved _and_ denied action.

```bash
# Dry-run — validates the capture region and audit log, sends no input
osrs-eval --checkpoint runs/ppo_woodcutting_v2/checkpoints/latest.pt \
          --live-config configs/live.yaml --episodes 1

# Real-input — flip enable_live_input: true in configs/live.yaml first,
# then prepare the kill switch in another terminal:
#   touch /tmp/osrs_rl_stop   # halt immediately
#   rm    /tmp/osrs_rl_stop   # resume
osrs-eval --checkpoint runs/ppo_woodcutting_v2/checkpoints/latest.pt \
          --live-config configs/live.yaml --episodes 1
```

macOS users: `mss` needs Screen Recording permission and `pynput` needs Accessibility
permission for the terminal (System Settings → Privacy & Security).

## Domain randomization (sim-to-real preparation)

The single biggest obstacle to moving a simulator-trained vision policy onto real
OSRS frames is that it has memorized the exact pixel statistics of one renderer.
Domain randomization attacks that directly: every episode, the simulator re-samples
visual dimensions the policy *should* ignore, forcing the CNN to learn features that
are invariant to that noise.

**What gets randomized** (all behind independent config flags, zero-valued = no-op):

| family | per-episode | what it perturbs |
|---|:-:|---|
| palette jitter | ✔ | grass / tree / stump / agent / HUD colors (RGB offset) |
| HUD side | ✔ | inventory bar flips between top and bottom of the frame |
| distractor clutter | ✔ | random decorative tiles (not trees) scattered on empty ground |
| tree-size jitter | ✔ | tree sprites randomly shrink by a few pixels per side |
| brightness jitter | — | per-frame multiplicative brightness |
| contrast jitter | — | per-frame multiplicative contrast around mid-gray |
| pixel noise | — | per-frame additive Gaussian noise |

![dr samples](docs/results/dr_samples.png)

Same task — find and chop trees — but every one of those frames looks different.

### Experiment: baseline policy vs domain-randomized policy

Two identical training runs (300k steps, same seed, same hyperparameters) — the only
delta is the `randomization` block. Each policy was then evaluated on both the
baseline simulator and the randomized simulator over 30 episodes.

![robustness](docs/results/robustness.png)

| eval env | **baseline policy** | **DR-trained policy** | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| return on baseline sim | +18.04 | **+21.51** | **+3.5 pts** |
| return on randomized sim | +16.89 | **+18.48** | **+1.6 pts** |
| success rate on baseline sim | 4.0% | **10.0%** | **+6 pp** |
| success rate on randomized sim | **0.0%** | **6.7%** | **+6.7 pp** |
| trees chopped / ep (randomized sim) | 3.90 | 3.80 | ≈ |

Two readings worth making explicit:

1. **DR acts as a regularizer.** The DR-trained policy is the best policy on *both*
   environments, including the undisturbed baseline it was never trained on directly.
   This is a well-known phenomenon in autonomy research — forcing invariance often
   improves in-distribution performance too, because the policy stops latching onto
   spurious pixel-level features.
2. **The success-rate panel is the clean win.** The baseline policy's success rate
   collapses from 4% to 0% the moment the visuals are perturbed; the DR policy holds
   at 6.7%. This is exactly the kind of robustness gap that determines whether a
   sim-trained policy survives transfer to a new renderer (or real OSRS).

```

### Honest caveats

- **Randomized-sim performance is a proxy, not a verdict on real OSRS.** The DR
  simulator still produces clean tiled frames; real OSRS has text, menus, NPCs, and
  lighting that none of the randomization families capture.
- **The distractor clutter palette is hand-chosen.** A harder distractor set (e.g.,
  tree-colored noise tiles) would reduce the robustness margin.
- **Success rate is still low in absolute terms** (6.7% for the DR policy on DR sim).
  The bottleneck is still the argmax-collapse issue documented in [Limitations](#limitations)
  — DR improves robustness without solving the representation problem, which is what
  the next milestone (recurrent policy) targets.

## Recurrent policy (LSTM) — a hypothesis, rigorously falsified

The M4 results suggested the argmax-collapse and success-rate plateau came from
partial observability: the policy sees one framestacked window at a time and can't
track "which tree am I walking toward". A natural fix is to give the policy
**short-horizon memory** via a single LSTM layer between the CNN encoder and the
actor/critic heads.

### Architecture

```

Hidden state is reset per step whenever `episode_starts[t] == 1` (i.e. the obs came
from an env auto-reset). Minibatches during updates **partition envs, not
timesteps** — each minibatch is a full length-`T` sequence for a subset of envs,
so temporal order is preserved and PPO replays the LSTM through each sequence from
the correct initial hidden state.

Implementation lives behind `cfg.ppo.recurrent: true`:
`src/osrs_rl/agents/ppo.py::RecurrentPPOActorCritic`,
`RecurrentPPOTrainer`, `RecurrentRolloutBuffer`. Feedforward path is unchanged.

### Experiment: same budget, same hyperparameters, one config delta

300k steps, identical seed, identical reward, identical PPO knobs. Evaluated over
50 fresh episodes under both stochastic sampling and deterministic argmax.

![feedforward vs recurrent](docs/results/recurrent_vs_feedforward.png)

| metric | feedforward | recurrent (LSTM) | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| stochastic return | +18.04 | +19.57 | **+1.5 pts** |
| deterministic return | −3.36 | −3.36 | — |
| stochastic success rate | 4.0% | 4.0% | — |
| stochastic idle ratio | 0.3% | 1.1% | slightly worse |
| stochastic invalid-action ratio | 0.45 | 0.37 | small improvement |
| deterministic INTERACT share | 100% | 100% | argmax still collapses |

### Interpretation

The recurrent policy gave a small stochastic-return bump and a modest reduction in
invalid actions, but **did not resolve the two behaviors the hypothesis was meant
to explain**:

1. **Argmax collapse persists, identically.** With deterministic action selection
   both policies pick INTERACT on every step. The LSTM's hidden state successfully
   encodes *something*, but whatever it encodes does not move INTERACT out of the
   top-logit slot when the agent isn't adjacent to a tree.
2. **Success rate unchanged at 4%.** The same post-chop navigation failure mode
   the feedforward policy has, the recurrent policy also has.

The honest read: **the bottleneck is in the CNN encoder, not in policy memory.**
At 84×84 grayscale with 8×8 tile-sized features, the representation the CNN
produces apparently doesn't cleanly separate "tree adjacent" from "tree in line of
sight but two tiles away." No amount of downstream memory reconstructs information
that was never in the features to begin with.

This is a **valuable negative result** for the portfolio — a clean ablation that
falsifies a plausible-sounding hypothesis. The redirection it implies is concrete:
next-step work should attack the **representation** (higher resolution, RGB
channels, auxiliary supervised loss on adjacency labels) rather than adding more
recurrence or capacity on top of the existing features.

### Reproduce

```

## Next steps: sim-to-real

Domain randomization has landed, and the recurrent-policy ablation above points the
next work squarely at the **representation**, not the algorithm. In priority order:

1. **Higher input resolution + RGB channels.** 84×84 grayscale collapses
   adjacency into 1–2 pixel differences after the CNN downsampling stack. Moving
   to 128×128 RGB (or fine-scale local crops around the cursor) is the single
   highest-leverage change implied by the recurrent-PPO ablation — the feature
   map is what's missing information, so expanding it is how to reclaim it.
2. **Auxiliary supervised loss on adjacency labels.** Add a small classification
   head during training that predicts "tree adjacent to agent" from the CNN
   features, with labels taken directly from the simulator. Forces the backbone
   to linearly separate that concept.
3. **Real-frame fine-tuning.** Same aux-loss trick but with a few hundred
   labeled OSRS screenshots — closes the sim-to-real feature gap.
4. **Harder distractor clutter.** Add distractors shaped like trees-with-wrong-color
   and trees-with-wrong-size to force the CNN to use shape features, not just color.
5. **CV-based action decoder.** Instead of a naive virtual cursor, have the live
   client detect tree pixels and expose a "click nearest tree" macro as an action —
   the policy then only has to choose _when_, not _where_.
